# Shut the Box Advanced
This system is the final project for Uppsala University's Informationssystem C Objektorienterad programmering II (2IS062) course. It is a console-based implementation of the classic board game Shut the Box, featuring many object-oriented design patterns and flexible gameplay options. The project was designed to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming by incorporating a wide range of design patterns and concepts covered in the course.

## Project Overview and Design Patterns
The primary goal of this project was to create a robust and extensible implementation of the Classic Shut the Box board game while implementing at least 18 design patterns taught in the course in a meaningful way.

To meet these requirements, our team strategically integrated concepts such as Dependency Injection, Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern, Generic Types, Collections, Lambdas, LINQ, and others into the project. Each concept was carefully implemented and documented in the codebase with comments following the required format:

```
// 1: [Concept Name]
// 2: [Explanation of how the concept is used]
// 3: [Motivation for why the concept is used]
```

The use of these design patterns served the purpose of learning to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable system, which was later presented at the course's Projektmässa to demonstrate its functionality and design.
